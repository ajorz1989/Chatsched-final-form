  { term: "Channel", category: "Marketplace basics", definition: "One of the five kinds of audience a business can advertise through: social media, influencer, website, podcast, or radio.", link: { to: "/channels", label: "See all channels" } },
  { term: "Request", category: "Marketplace basics", definition: "What a business submits to a publisher asking to be featured. A publisher reviews it and can approve or decline." },
  { term: "Campaign", category: "Marketplace basics", definition: "What a request becomes once it's approved — tracked from approval through payment, going live, and confirmation." },
  { term: "Escrow", category: "Money & timing", definition: "Where a business's payment is held once a campaign is approved. It's released to the publisher only once the placement is confirmed live — not before, and not automatically on approval alone.", link: { to: "/how-payment-works", label: "See the full payment timeline" } },
  { term: "Platform commission", category: "Money & timing", definition: `The flat ${commissionPct}% fee ChatSched takes from every booking. Applied the same way regardless of channel or publisher size.` },
  { term: "Publisher share", category: "Money & timing", definition: `The ${sharePct}% of a booking a publisher keeps after commission — the majority of every placement, by design.` },
  { term: "Approval window", category: "Money & timing", definition: `The ${CREATOR_APPROVAL_WINDOW_DAYS} days a publisher has to approve or decline a request before it expires.` },

  { term: "Suggested Price", category: "Pricing", definition: "A publisher's calculated starting rate for a placement — based on their follower count, engagement relative to a typical baseline, and trust score. A guide to negotiate from, not a fixed rule.", link: { to: "/publisher-success/how-to-price-your-advertising", label: "Read the pricing guide" } },
  { term: "Trust score", category: "Pricing", definition: "A 0–100 score reflecting a publisher's track record on the platform. New publishers start at a neutral midpoint and it moves as they build a history — it's one of the inputs to Suggested Price, not a public reputation badge." },
  { term: "Verification tiers", category: "Trust & safety", definition: "How verified a business is: Bronze (email verified), Silver (email and phone verified), Gold (full business verification on file). Shown to publishers deciding whether to accept a request." },
  { term: "Authenticity signal", category: "Trust & safety", definition: "An automated flag raised during publisher review when something looks off — engagement far outside a normal range, reach that vastly exceeds followers, pricing well outside the suggested band. A prompt for a closer look, not an automatic rejection." },
