/**
 * Covers the public marketing surface only — Header, Footer, Home,
 * HowItWorks, ForBusinesses, ForPublishers — deliberately not the
 * authenticated app (dashboards, forms, admin). Those stay English-only
 * for now: translating live transactional UI carries real correctness
 * risk (a mistranslated payment/escrow term is a much bigger problem than
 * a mistranslated marketing headline), and it's the marketing pages that
 * actually drive whether a South African SME owner who reads Afrikaans,
 * isiXhosa, or isiZulu first even gets as far as signing up. See
 * SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES below and supabase/DEPLOY.md's "Localization"
 * section for how to extend this to more pages/languages later — it's
 * just more keys in more JSON files, no code changes needed.
 *
 * Missing keys silently fall back to English (fallbackLng below) rather
 * than showing a raw "home.hero.title"-style key — important since
 * isiXhosa/isiZulu coverage here is a first pass, not yet reviewed by a
 * native speaker (flagged clearly in DEPLOY.md).
