/**
 * Channel-specific onboarding field schemas.
 *
 * `publishers.channel_metadata` (schema_phase74) is a plain `jsonb` column
 * on purpose — see that migration's own comment on why a single shared
 * typed shape across all 12 channels would force incompatible metrics to
 * look equivalent (the expansion doc's own Section 21 warning, applied to
 * schema design rather than just UI copy). But "the column is loosely
 * typed" doesn't mean the data going into it should be — these are the
 * real, precise shapes for every channel, chosen from each channel's own
 * actual advertisingMethods/description in src/channels/*\/index.ts, not
 * invented generically.
 *
 * All 12 channels now have a typed schema — CHANNEL_UPDATES_AUDIT.md's own
 * "not done" list named this gap; closed here. Podcast, Informal Retail,
 * and Sports were the original three (deliberately contrasting, chosen to
 * prove the pattern generalizes); Social Media, Website, Influencer,
 * Radio, Events, Community, Transport, Associations, and Restaurants are
 * the remaining nine, added in the same session that closed the gap.
 * Where two channels are genuinely the same shape underneath (Community's
 * and Associations' reach channels; Community's newsletter cadence and
 * Podcast's episode frequency), they share the same type rather than
 * duplicating a near-identical enum — see each section's own comment for
 * which and why.

// ── Podcast ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// of this has any equivalent on a channel with no concept of an "episode."

export type PodcastFrequency = "weekly" | "biweekly" | "monthly" | "irregular";

export interface PodcastOnboardingFields {

  adSlotsAvailable: PodcastAdSlot[];
  topListenerRegions: string[]; // South African provinces primarily, but not constrained to them — some shows have real reach beyond SA
}

// ── Informal Retail (Spaza Shops & Township Traders) ───────────────────
// Physical-shop-shaped: foot traffic, trading hours, whether the shop even
// has the infrastructure (till, WhatsApp list) some placements need. No
// "episode" or "listener" concept applies here at all — the contrast with
// Podcast above is the point.

export interface InformalRetailOnboardingFields {
  estimatedDailyFootTraffic: number;
  tradingHours: string; // free text — "06:00–20:00, 7 days" reads more naturally to an owner than two separate time fields
  hasElectronicTill: boolean; // gates till-slip-sponsor eligibility specifically (see src/channels/informal-retail's advertisingMethods)
  hasWhatsappBroadcastList: boolean;
  whatsappBroadcastListSize: number | null; // null unless hasWhatsappBroadcastList is true

  priceRangeZAR: { min: number; max: number }; // what this specific shop actually charges, vs. the channel-wide minBudgetZAR floor
}

// ── Sports Teams & Leagues ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// Organisation-shaped: competition structure, season, and — unlike the two
// above — a real authority question, because "I run this Instagram page"
// and "I can sell this club's sponsorship inventory" are different claims
// (Section 53 of the expansion doc).

// leaving it on only the generic fields forever.

}

// ── Website ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// sells is attention measured in visits and placement inventory, not
// followers — a website has no "follower" concept at all.

  averageSessionDurationSeconds: number | null; // null if not tracked — many smaller sites genuinely don't have analytics set up
}

// ── Influencer ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Person-and-format-shaped: a named individual's own reach and content
// style, distinct from Social Media above (a page/account, not
// necessarily a personal brand) even though both live on similar
// platforms — the expansion doc's own Section 21 reasoning for why these
// stay separate channels applies to their onboarding data too.

  offersUsageRights: boolean; // whether the creator will license content for the business's own use beyond the original post — a real, separately-negotiated line item in influencer deals
}

// ── Radio ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Broadcast-shaped like Podcast, but live/scheduled rather than
// on-demand/downloaded — coverage area and listenership matter here in a
// way "downloads per episode" never captures.

export interface RadioOnboardingFields {
  stationName: string;
  frequencyOrStream: string; // e.g. "94.5 FM" or "online-only stream URL" — one free-text field, since not every station has a terrestrial frequency
  coverageArea: string; // e.g. "Cape Town metro", "Eastern Cape province-wide"
  broadcastLanguages: string[]; // e.g. ["isiXhosa", "English"] — South Africa's 11 official languages plus others some community stations use, not a closed enum
  averageDailyListenership: number | null; // null if not independently measured — many community stations don't have formal ratings data
  availableSlotLengths: RadioAdSlotLength[];
  showSponsorshipAvailable: boolean; // whether a specific show/timeslot can be sponsored, vs. only rotation ad spots
}

// ── Events ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Occasion-shaped: a specific date (or recurring series), an expected
// crowd, and — since sponsorship here is usually tiered — what tiers the
// organiser actually offers, unlike every always-on channel above.

export type EventType = "conference" | "tournament" | "festival" | "concert" | "trade_show" | "community_gathering";

  venueCity: string;
}

// ── Community ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Group-shaped: what kind of group, how it actually reaches its members
// (a newsletter and a WhatsApp group are very different sponsorship
// inventory even though both are "community"), and how often.

export type CommunityGroupType = "neighbourhood_association" | "hobby_or_interest_group" | "professional_network" | "club" | "religious_or_faith_group" | "school_or_alumni_group";

  reachChannels: CommunityReachChannel[];
  newsletterFrequency: PodcastFrequency | "none"; // reusing Podcast's cadence enum plus "none" — "how often does content go out" is genuinely the same shape as episode frequency, and forcing a fourth near-identical enum into existence would be exactly the incompatible-shapes-forced-to-look-equivalent mistake this file's header warns against in the other direction
  geographicArea: string; // e.g. "Sandton", "Stellenbosch" — most community groups are hyper-local
}

// ── Transport ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Fleet-and-route-shaped: minibus taxi advertising sells against vehicles
// and routes, not audience metrics at all — the least "media-shaped"
// channel in this set, on purpose (expansion doc's own point about
// widening what counts as a publisher).

export type TransportOperatorType = "individual_owner" | "taxi_association" | "fleet_operator";

  estimatedDailyPassengers: number | null; // null if not tracked — most individual owners genuinely don't count this
  placementTypesAvailable: TransportPlacementType[];
  primaryRank: string; // the taxi rank this operator is most associated with, if any
}

// ── Associations ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Membership-body-shaped: similar reach-channel concept to Community, but
// distinctly B2B and often has a real, checkable directory-listing
// artifact — the two channels look adjacent but the audience and the
// trust claim being sold are different (same reasoning Influencer vs.
// Social Media above draws on).

export type AssociationType = "chamber_of_commerce" | "industry_body" | "networking_group" | "trade_union" | "professional_body";

export interface AssociationsOnboardingFields {
  associationType: AssociationType;

  reachChannels: CommunityReachChannel[]; // same set of concepts as Community (newsletter/WhatsApp/etc.) — genuinely the same shape, not force-fit
  hasMemberDirectory: boolean; // gates directory-listing-sponsor eligibility specifically, same pattern as Informal Retail's hasElectronicTill gating till-slip-sponsor
  hostsRegularEvents: boolean;
}

// ── Restaurants ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Venue-and-throughput-shaped: seating and daily covers, not audience —
// closest in spirit to Informal Retail (a physical venue with foot
// traffic) but with its own distinct placement inventory (menus, table
// cards, receipts) that a spaza shop doesn't have.

export type RestaurantVenueType = "sit_down_restaurant" | "cafe" | "quick_service" | "bar_or_pub" | "food_truck_or_stall";
export type RestaurantPlacementType = "menu_sponsorship" | "table_card" | "receipt_or_qr" | "loyalty_card" | "digital_menu_screen" | "waiting_area_screen";

  placementTypesAvailable: RestaurantPlacementType[];
  cuisineType: string; // free text — too varied for a closed list
}

// ── Discriminated access, not a discriminated union on Publisher itself ──
// Publisher.channel_metadata stays loosely typed (Record<string, unknown> |
// null) because TypeScript can't correlate it with the sibling
// channel_slug field without turning Publisher into a discriminated union
// everywhere it's used — a much bigger change than this warrants. These
// helpers give real typing at the point of use instead, where the caller
// already knows (or is checking) the channel.
