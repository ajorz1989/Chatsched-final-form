/**
 * Feature Flags — Advertising Channels
 *
 * Each non-core channel is gated behind a Vite environment variable, but the
 * *meaning* of that variable differs by channel maturity:
 *
 *   - social-media  — always on, not a flag at all (the core marketplace).
 *   - influencer / podcast / website / radio — launched. Default ON. Their
 *     env var is a kill switch: set it to "false" to pull one back into
 *     "coming soon" without a code deploy. Leaving it unset means live.
 *
 * Adding a new (not-yet-launched) channel:
 *   1. Add the slug to ChannelSlug in channelTypes.ts
 *   2. Add its env key to FLAG_ENV_KEYS below (it will default OFF —
 *      only slugs listed in DEFAULT_ON default to true when unset)
 *   3. Create the channel module in src/channels/<slug>/index.ts
 *   4. Register it in src/lib/channelRegistry.ts
 *   Done — no other file needs to change.
