/**
 * The `/campaigns/:id` workspace (CampaignWorkspace.tsx) is deliberately
 * NOT backed by a new master "campaigns" table — `:id` is the same
 * requests/channel_requests row id every other campaign-scoped page
 * already uses (getCampaignComplianceById in lib/compliance.ts checks
 * both tables the same way). This just adds one normalized shape on top
 * so the workspace's tabs don't each need their own "which flow is this"
 * branch — they read amount/status/participants off WorkspaceCampaign and
 * only fall back to `.raw` for flow-specific fields.
 *
 * Deliberately doesn't select publishers.user_id in these joins (even
 * though RLS would allow it once the row is visible at all) — same
 * narrower-surface choice CampaignCompliance.tsx makes, resolving "is the
 * current viewer the creator" via a second, targeted single-column query
 * instead. See isWorkspaceCreator() below.
