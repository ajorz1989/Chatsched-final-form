/**
 * Per-page title + meta description, using React 19's native support for
 * hoisting <title>/<meta> rendered anywhere in the tree up to <head> — no
 * react-helmet needed. Render this once near the top of a page component.
 *
 * Route changes unmount the previous page (and its <title>) before mounting
 * the next one, so there's no duplicate-tag buildup between pages. Don't
 * also hardcode a <title> in index.html's body content or render more than
 * one <Seo> per page — React's hoisting doesn't deduplicate, it just adds.
 *
 * Note: this only helps the browser tab/history and crawlers that execute
 * JavaScript (Googlebot does). Most social-preview bots (Facebook, WhatsApp,
 * X, LinkedIn) fetch raw HTML and never run your JS, so they'll always see
 * index.html's static tags, never these per-page ones. Real per-page social
 * previews would need server-side rendering — a bigger change than fits
 * here, and not the highest priority at this stage.
