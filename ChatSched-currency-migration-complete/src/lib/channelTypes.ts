/**
 * Universal Advertising Channel Model
 *
 * Every advertising channel in the ChatSched marketplace conforms to

 *
 * Scope rule: every type here must directly help a business discover a
 * publisher, create a campaign, buy advertising, or measure results.

// ─── Channel identity ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// Trimmed to the 5 channels the marketplace actually runs (social-media, plus
// the 4 launched in the same pass this comment was added). Eight placeholder
// channels — whatsapp, newsletter, email-campaigns, sms, community-events,
// digital-billboards, newspaper, ai-media-buying — were removed outright
// (definitions deleted, not just disabled) as part of that same change.
//
// Phase 74 added sports, events, community. Phase 75 adds two more: transport
// (minibus taxi advertising — the single largest daily-transit audience in
// the country, not covered by any of the other 9) and informal-retail (spaza
// shops/township traders — off the original expansion doc entirely, picked
// because it's the most direct match for "community markets and informal
// traders" ChatSched already says it serves). Same posture as Phase 74: own
// channel module, own feature flag, ships inactive until real owners exist.
