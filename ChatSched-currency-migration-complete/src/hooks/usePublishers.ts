 * Call after a publisher's own listing changes so their edit shows up
 * immediately wherever usePublishers() is read, instead of waiting out
 * the cache's 60s stale time. Wired into PublisherDashboardView.tsx and
 * PortfolioManager.tsx's self-service update calls.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT wired into Admin.tsx's publisher mutations (approve/
 * reject/suspend/feature/verify) — Admin.tsx queries the publishers table
 * directly for its own table view rather than through this cache, so
 * those actions don't need this to stay correct in Admin's own UI. Their
 * effect on the public-facing pages that DO use this cache (Browse, Home,
 * etc.) becomes visible within the 60s stale window — an intentional,
 * standard caching tradeoff, not an oversight. A newly-approved publisher
 * appearing in public search a few seconds to a minute later is a
 * reasonable cost for not re-fetching the entire directory on every page
 * visit; a publisher not seeing their OWN edit reflected promptly would
 * actually feel broken, which is the distinction this function exists for.
