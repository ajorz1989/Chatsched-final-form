      <p>
        These Terms & Conditions govern your use of ChatSched, whether you're registering as a Business/Advertiser or as a Publisher/Creator. By creating an account or using the platform, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree with them, please don't use the platform.

          ChatSched is a marketplace that connects Businesses with Publishers/Creators, and provides the tools to submit requests, approve or decline them, schedule placements, and process payment between the two parties. We are not a party to the advertising arrangement itself — the content, quality, and delivery of a campaign is agreed between the Business and the Publisher/Creator directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't guarantee outcomes such as sales, engagement, or audience response from any campaign. We do our best to verify publishers before they're listed, but we can't guarantee the accuracy of every follower count, reach figure, or audience claim a creator provides.

          <li>Keep your login credentials confidential and be responsible for activity under your account.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Illegal products, services, or activities.</li>
          <li>Hate speech, harassment, or discriminatory content.</li>

          We reserve the right to decline, remove, or suspend a listing or campaign request that breaches these standards, and to suspend the account responsible.

        <p>
          Businesses submit a feature request to a Publisher/Creator describing what they'd like promoted. The Publisher/Creator has {CREATOR_APPROVAL_WINDOW_DAYS} days to approve or decline the request — unanswered requests simply expire. Once approved, the Publisher/Creator schedules and carries out the placement, and marks it live once it's done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Either party may decline a request they're not comfortable with, for any legitimate reason, before it's approved.

        <p>Our financial model works as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Platform commission:</strong> ChatSched charges a {commissionPct}% commission on the value of each completed campaign. The Publisher/Creator receives the remaining {100 - commissionPct}%.</li>
          <li><strong>Business payment timing:</strong> once a Publisher/Creator approves a request, the Business has {BUSINESS_PAYMENT_WINDOW_DAYS} days to pay the platform directly. Nothing goes live until that payment is confirmed.</li>
          <li><strong>Creator payout timing:</strong> once a placement is confirmed live, the Publisher/Creator is paid out within {CREATOR_PAYOUT_WINDOW_HOURS} hours.</li>
          <li>All fees and figures are shown in South African Rand (ZAR) and may be updated from time to time — the current figures always apply at the time a request is submitted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Payment processing for online transactions is handled by a third-party payment gateway (such as PayFast); we don't store your full card details.

          To the maximum extent permitted by law, ChatSched is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential loss arising from your use of the platform, including loss of revenue, business, or goodwill resulting from a campaign's performance or a dispute between a Business and a Publisher/Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing in these terms limits any liability that cannot lawfully be limited or excluded under South African law, including the Consumer Protection Act where it applies.

          If a disagreement arises between a Business and a Publisher/Creator about a campaign, both parties should first try to resolve it directly through the platform's messaging tools. If that doesn't work, either party can contact us to help mediate, though we're not obligated to make a binding decision in every case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Disputes about these Terms themselves are governed by South African law, and the courts of South Africa have jurisdiction over them.
