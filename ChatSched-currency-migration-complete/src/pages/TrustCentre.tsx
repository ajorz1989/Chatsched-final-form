        </h2>
        <p className="text-sm text-billboard-inkSoft mb-6 max-w-2xl">
          Verification on ChatSched is layered, not a single tick box. Every account starts with the basics —
          confirming an email address is real and a phone number actually belongs to whoever's applying — and
          builds up from there as more is confirmed.

          <h3 className="font-display text-base mb-1.5">Phone confirmation, the same way everywhere</h3>
          <p className="text-sm text-billboard-inkSoft">
            Whether it's a business profile or a publisher listing, phone verification works the same way: a
            one-time code is sent by SMS, the code is checked, and only a successful match flips the "phone
            verified" flag. Codes expire and can't be reused, and nobody — including our own team — can read
            a code back out once it's issued.

            Verification confirms an email is real, a phone number belongs to the applicant, or (at the top
            tier) that a business registration checks out. It's not a promise about how a campaign will
            perform — follower counts and engagement are still self-reported by the publisher, which is
            exactly why the dispute process below exists as a backstop.

            <li><strong className="text-billboard-ink">3. Both sides make their case.</strong> A dispute has its own message thread, separate from the regular booking chat, so the discussion around the disagreement stays together in one place.</li>
