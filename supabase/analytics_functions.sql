-- Analytics RPCs for admin dashboard
-- Returns overview metrics and time series for GMV, requests, approvals, and growth.
--
-- Margin/economics pass (added alongside the agency-pivot subscriptions in
-- schema_phase55_subscriptions.sql): fixes a real completeness gap found
-- while extending this file rather than a fresh read of the brief —
-- GMV/requests here only ever queried `payments`/`requests`, which is the
-- ORIGINAL social-media/PayFast flow. The 4 newer channels
-- (influencer/website/podcast/radio) settle entirely on
-- `channel_requests` itself (proposed_amount + paid_at — see
-- schema_phase17_channel_marketplace.sql's own comment on why: no PayFast
-- checkout on that path, so no payments row ever gets written for it) and
-- have been invisible to every number on this dashboard since phase17
-- shipped. Every function below now sums both. `total_gmv` and the 'gmv'
-- time-series/segment metrics are corrected in place (not renamed) since
-- an incomplete "GMV" is simply wrong, not a different, narrower thing
-- worth preserving under the same name — same reasoning applies to
-- request counts. Commission-rate and subscription-price math is
-- deliberately NOT done here — those live once, in
-- src/lib/constants.ts (PLATFORM_COMMISSION_RATE,
-- PUBLISHER_SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE, BUSINESS_SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE), and
-- AdminAnalytics.tsx multiplies the raw counts/GMV this file returns by
-- those — so the rate can't drift between a SQL copy and the TS one.
